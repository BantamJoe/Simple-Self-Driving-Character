# Simple-Self-Driving-Character

> Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim. All praise be to Allah, Who teaches human to His Kalam and gives him a skills. *This expression is **not** propaganda. It expresses only a tribute of respect and gratitude of the author to the true Creator.*

Simple self driving character project on Unity, with machine learning was inspired by [Udacity self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). 

The aim of this project - is to help people to upgrade their skills, increase knowledge and share some ideas in machine learning. 

## Content
This project consist of two main parts: 
1. Unity part
2. Machine learning part

Also project has one additional part: 

3. Dataset. 

### Unity part
Unity project responsible for environment, agent & environment interaction and data collecting. In order to describe this part in more detail we gonna divide it to some logical blocks:

+ Map
+ Character control
+ Data collecting
+ TCP Socket communication

#### Map
On environment map we have 5 zones, 2 of them are passable in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. They are shown at the picture below with names.

Red dots represents starting points at each zone. The zones Octus and Quadro are passable in both directions.

You can choose the zone on "Choose zone" menu.

#### Character control
The character is controlling using the keyboard "arrow" buttons.

At any time of character controlling process you can press "Esc" button and choose another zone.

#### Data collecting
You can start collecting your data by chosing "Collecting data for training" mode at the "Choose mode" menu.

Then you need to choose zone on "Choose zone" menu. And finally you get playing screen on which you have 2 buttons and field that displays name of current zone. Press "Start collecting!" button when you will be ready to collect data. You can finish collecting data by pressing "Stop collecting!" button. "Restart" button will return you to initial coordinates and direction.

The data collected by simulating ["lidar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar). Simulation provides by ray casting as on [Udacity self driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). It has vertical slice consist of 64 rays. Rays start at +12.7 degrees from the horizon, to -37.3 degrees (picture A). It has 180 degree view range by horizontal, from left to right (picture B). So we get by one slice for each of 180 degree. So we get pictures with a resolution of 180Ñ…64 pixels, with green channel only (picture C). Each pixel displays the distance from the character to the object. The maximal distance is 120.

For each zone created it's own folder called "Zone_name Dataset" with subfolder called "images" which contains an images generated by lidar. All images from specific zone saves to its specified folder. There is also a file called "labels.csv". In first column of this file are recording names of generated images with ".jpg" extension. The second column contain an direction of character at the moment of generating an image from the first column.

*Example*

|    Image Name    | Direction |
|------------------|:---------:|
|   image_1.jpg    |     1     |
|   image_2.jpg    |     4     |
|   image_3.jpg    |     2     |

There are four directions:

| Symbol |  Name   |   Button    |
|:------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
|    1   | Forward |  Up Arrow   |
|    2   |  Right  | Right Arrow |
|    3   |  Stop   | Down Arrow  |
|    4   |  Left   | Left Arrow  |

#### TCP Socket communication
There is a class in the project called "TCPConnection" which responsible for environment & agent interaction via TCP sockets. To connect to the agent
